### Debugging in VS Code
Setting Up Debugging:

Create a launch.json file: This file configures how VS Code launches your program for debugging. You can usually find a template by creating a new file and selecting "launch.json" as the name.

Configure launch tasks: Edit the launch.json file to specify the program to debug, its arguments, and any other relevant settings based on your programming language or framework. Refer to VS Code documentation or extension documentation for specific instructions.
Set breakpoints: Click on the line numbers in your code editor where you want to pause execution during debugging.

### Starting Debugging:

Start Debugging Session: Go to the Run and Debug view (Activity Bar) or use the keyboard shortcut (F5).

Step Through Code: Use the debugger controls (buttons or keyboard shortcuts) to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and examine the call stack.
Set Breakpoints: You can dynamically set or disable breakpoints during the debugging session.

#### Key Debugging Features:

Breakpoints: Pause execution at specific points in your code.
Stepping: Execute code line by line or step into functions.
Variable Inspection: View the values of variables at any point during execution.
Call Stack: See the sequence of function calls that led to the current execution point.
Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger under certain conditions.

### Using Source Control with VS Code
Making Commits:

Stage Changes: Use the Source Control view (Side Bar) to stage specific files or changes you want to include in your next commit. You can:

Click the checkbox next to a file to stage it entirely.
Use the "+" icon to stage specific lines of code within a file.
Commit: Once you've staged your changes, type a descriptive commit message in the commit message box at the bottom of the Source Control view. A good commit message should briefly explain what changes you made.

Commit Changes: Click the checkmark button next to the commit message box to commit your staged changes.

#### Pushing Changes to GitHub:
Create a Remote Repository (Optional): If you haven't already, create a new Git repository on GitHub (https://github.com) where you want to store your project's code.
Add Remote Repository URL: In the VS Code Terminal, use the git remote add origin <remote_repository_url> command, replacing <remote_repository_url> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

Push Changes: Once you have a remote repository configured, use the git push origin main command to push your local commits to the main branch of your GitHub repository.
